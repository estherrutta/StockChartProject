 ### This app observes a stream of assets and displays them on a table. The stream updates every second and the table will reflect those changes. Assets can be sorted by field by hovering over the column title and clicking on the down arrow to sort in ascending order, up arrow to sort in descending order, and the grey arrow icon will clear the sort. In addition, assets can be filtered for each field in the filter panel on top of the asset table.
  
  An asset can be marked as a favorite. A favorite will get pinned to the top of the list.
